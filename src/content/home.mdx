# Dr. Grace Brown

I am a social, economic and environmental justice expert, with almost a decade’s experience delivering cutting edge policy research for a range of progressive think-tanks, trade unions, local authorities, and charities. 

I have a PhD from the University of Glasgow, where I worked as part of the six-year European Research Council funded project, Global Remunicipalisation and the Post Neoliberal Turn. 

My PhD research focused on social movements organising for the collective ownership of life sustaining services, specifically energy. I explored social movement strategy within and against the neoliberal state, contending that state-movement relationships must be understood as a processual becoming and an undoing; movements themselves transform as they attempt to transform the neoliberal capitalist state.

I am an Advisory Board member for [Public Grids](https://www.publicgrids.org/), the organisation bringing grassroots organising and sector-leading expertise together to expand publicly owned power across the United States, from campaign to implementation.t.
